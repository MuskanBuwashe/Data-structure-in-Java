/*Problem statement
Given the head of a singly linked list of integers, find and return its length.


Example:
Sample Linked List

The length of the list is 4. Hence we return 4.

Note:
Exercise caution when dealing with edge cases, such as when the head is NULL. Failing to handle these edge cases appropriately may result in a runtime error in your code.
