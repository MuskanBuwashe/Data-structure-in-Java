/*Problem statement
For a given a string expression containing only round brackets or parentheses, check if they are balanced or not. Brackets are said to be balanced if the bracket which opens last, closes first.



Example:
Expression: (()())
Since all the opening brackets have their corresponding closing brackets, we say it is balanced and hence the output will be, 'true'.
You need to return a boolean value indicating whether the expression is balanced or not.

Note:
The input expression will not contain spaces in between.

Constraints:

 Where N is the length of the expression.

Time Limit: 1sec
